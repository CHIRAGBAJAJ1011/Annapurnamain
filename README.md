Annapurna provides the right channels for compassionate citizens to begin and manage initiatives, that solve hunger locally. The Annapurna is a non-profit platform in India that operates a food donation program. Annapurna is a website developed with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript along with Bootstrap. It serves as a smooth and easily accessible platform to make excess food available for backward and poor people of our economy. We aim to redistribute surplus food to those who are in need of it. If a person has excess food from an event, party, wedding, etc., then they can donate the food.
